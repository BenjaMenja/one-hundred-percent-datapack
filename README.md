# One Hundred Percent
One Hundred Percent is a datapack for *Minecraft* version 1.21.4. It automatically tracks your progress towards obtaining every item available to the player in survival Minecraft.

To use, type the slash (/) commands in your in-game chat bar:

 - /trigger show_items set (page): Shows the items your are missing on page (page). If there is no text on this page, that means the amount of items you have remaining does not reach this page.
 - /trigger ohp.notif: Enables/Disables the notification system, which sends an in-game chat notification to the player when they obtain an item for the first time.
